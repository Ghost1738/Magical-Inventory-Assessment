# Magical-Inventory-Assessment
Create a program that takes in an initial set of roles, magical material requirements for roles and magic requirements for magical materials. The program should then take in updates that include:
changing the magic requirement of a magical material, adding an existing magical needed by a
role, removing a magical material needed by a role, or changing the number of magical material
needed by a particular role. With each change, your program should quickly determine the new
total magic required by your school.
